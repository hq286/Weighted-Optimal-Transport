# Weighted-Optimal-Transport
This is the code for my master thesis project on optimal transport between images. Special thanks to Dr. Esteban Tabak, Dr. Debra Laefer and Dr. Monty Essid
# Progress 
The main code computes the linear map that minimizes KL-Divergence of two sets of samples with weights (i.e. two pixel images, weights being their pixel intensities). The algorithm that includes nonlinear terms in the optimal map is still under construction and testing.
